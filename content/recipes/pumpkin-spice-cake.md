## Ingredients

For cake:
- 2 and ¼ cups flour (I use all-purpose flour. King Arthur brand is my favorite)
- 2 tsp. baking powder
- 1 tsp. baking soda
- 2 tsp. cinnamon
- 1 tsp. ground allspice
- ¾ tsp. nutmeg
- ½ tsp. ground ginger
- ¼ tsp. ground cloves
- ½ tsp. salt
- 1 and ⅓ cups canned pumpkin
- ¾ cup buttermilk
- 1 tsp. vanilla
- 1 cup unsalted butter, room temperature
- 1 cup granulated sugar
- ¼ cup brown sugar
- 3 eggs (I use extra-large)

For frosting:
- ¾ cup unsalted butter, room temperature
- 8 oz. cream cheese, room temperature
- ¾ tsp. vanilla
- ½ tsp. cinnamon
- 3 cups powdered sugar
- 1 Tbsp. milk

## Directions

- Preheat oven to 350°. Spray a Bundt pan (I use a Bundt pan with 10 to 11 cup capacity) with Baker's Joy (or grease and flour). Set aside. Mix the flour, baking powder, baking soda, cinnamon, allspice, nutmeg, ginger, cloves, and salt in a bowl. Set aside. Mix pumpkin, buttermilk and vanilla in another bowl and set aside. In the bowl of a stand mixer (or use a hand mixer and a large bowl), beat the butter and sugars until fluffy (about 3 minutes). Add eggs and beat until incorporated. Reduce speed to low and add flour and pumpkin mixtures, alternating (beginning and ending with flour mixture). Pour batter into prepared Bundt pan. Bake for about 45 minutes (I recommend checking at 40 minutes) or until a toothpick inserted in the center comes out clean (crumbs on the toothpick are okay since it should be moist). Cool about 10 minutes and remove from pan. Let cool. Frost with cinnamon cream cheese frosting (see below) or simply sprinkle with powdered sugar and/or top slices with a dollop of whipped cream. Enjoy!
- For Cinnamon Cream Cheese Frosting: Using a stand mixer or hand mixer, beat ¾ cup unsalted butter (room temperature) and 8 oz. cream cheese (room temperature) for about 2 minutes on medium speed until fluffy. Mix until completely combined. Add ¾ tsp. vanilla and ½ tsp. cinnamon. Turn to low speed and slowly add 3 cups powdered sugar. Mix another 1 to 2 minutes until combined and fluffy. Add about 1 Tbsp. of milk and mix until combined. Move frosting to a bowl and microwave for about 20 to 30 seconds. This will make spreading/pouring the frosting easier.
